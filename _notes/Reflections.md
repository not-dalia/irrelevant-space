A friend once told me that a logo should always point forward, to convey a sense of progress and (...?). Deciding which direction my little doodle should be facing on the header took a bit of thinking, as I wanted to follow my friend's advice. I ended up going against it with the justification that looking backwards might convey a sense of reflection and (taking a step back?), which is what this space is meant to be about.

Looking away from all the text gave it a zoning-out vibe, which is very befitting of me.
