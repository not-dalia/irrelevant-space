Write about `IntersectionObserver` and animating first img on personal website

## The story
the images swap to gif on hover, but how do you replicate this playful experience when using a touch screen? maybe the solution is not about the touch screen, but about making it on phone.

## TODO
using css you can check capabilites of what sort of pointer the device has and if the pointer hovers. this instead of screen width can drive the animation.
