Short stories that I've read and liked (also check everydayfiction):
- 4thWriter Prize Winner: A Good Son by Tian Yi (I would love to read more by the same author)
- Can we read the other stories? (specifically Benjamin Toma James one)
- Dementia related: https://everydayfiction.com/marcela-by-carl-boon/ (also the book Near Nature: Poetry of Dementia/John Killick)
