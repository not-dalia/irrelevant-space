Keeping an eye on the conversations around [CHI 2025](https://chi2025.acm.org/) submissions on Twitter (Officially X), I thought I'd document some of the changes to the abstract submission process and guidelines for future reference. This is my personal collection of observations – not in any way official, but might be of help for next year's submissions. 

## Editing title and abstract after submission

The PCS form can't be updated after submission. However, the PDF submission can have minor edits to title and abstract. 

## Desk Rejections

According to the email communication in [this tweet](https://x.com/HaijunXia/status/1832503549483446515/), the process behind desk rejections involves:
- Papers for which PCS still showed missing data after the paper submission deadline were desk rejected. 
- Papers with unusually short titles (less than four words) were checked by the chairs, and were desk rejected if the title was found to be not sufficiently descriptive or confusing to reviewers.
- Papers with unusually short abstracts (less than 50 words) were similarly reviewed. 
- Abstracts with incomplete thoughts (e.g., left out results or implications) were desk rejected.

It is worth noting that some of the desk rejections based on title length have been reviewed and reverted. It's not yet clear if this means that the title length rule is no longer in place.

Again, this is just what I've picked up from Twitter chatter and is in no way official. I'm hoping these guidelines will be communicated more clearly for CHI 2026. Always check the [official CHI guidelines](https://chi2025.acm.org/for-authors/papers/) before you submit.
