	- if you click something then need to change your options you can scroll to the bottom, but possibly there's infinite scrolling so it will be impossible to reach unless you press End key
	- there's a Legitemate Interest tab that has things enabled by default but you only see that if you switch to the tab but if you hit the Reject All button it turns them off (thank for for the reject all). what does this even do?

## Notes
> After the introduction of the GDPR, website owners found themselves stuck – the new regulations required them to obtain consent from users, but many didn’t even know what trackers they had on their websites, let alone how to ask users to consent. That’s when the European branch of the Interactive Advertising Bureau ([IAB Europe](https://iabeurope.eu/)), an online advertising industry organisation, stepped in. In April of 2018, a month before the GDPR was implemented, IAB Europe published the [Transparency and Consent Framework](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework) (TCF), a set of technical specifications to “help the digital advertising industry interpret, and comply with EU rules on [data protection](https://www.vice.com/en/topic/data-protection) and privacy”.

>This framework created a standardised way for consent to be registered through specific lines of code. It also introduced new actors called Consent Management Platforms (CMPs), including, for example, [Quantcast](https://www.quantcast.com/), [OneTrust](https://www.onetrust.com/) and [Cookiebot](https://www.cookiebot.com/en/). CMPs are services that scan websites for cookies and compile customisable cookie banners that allow the website owner to be more or less compliant with the law. That’s why consent pop-ups often look the same across different sites.
